# DevNotes

This is another project that I've made with the "Front-end Training course - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and +". I'd like to point out that a lot of the HTML/CSS I did myself (which is a big win for me, which I'm getting back to coding now).
Unfortunately I couldn't work on the JS part by myself, but concepts and techniques of manipulating functions and events sounded natural and not very complex to me, so we have another victory here.

## What does DevNote do?

- Create notes
- Fix your notes
- Update your notes
- Copy a note 
- Delete the notes you want
- Search for a specific note (if you've already done it)

  ### Bonus

  Your notes are saved in local storage(I want to point out that with so much crud I made, it was easy to understand this concept, even though it was different from what I did with postgres and etc.)

  - [x] Complete the first stage of the project
  - [ ] Use a database to save notes
  - [ ] Make it responsive
